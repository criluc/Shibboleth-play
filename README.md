Shibboleth is a federated identity management protocol popular in higher education. The protocol provides a single sign on service across multiple organizational boundaries with secure attribute delivery. Shibboleth support requires that your application be proxies behind a Shibboleth capable web server such as Apache, Lighttpd, or IIS with the corresponding Shibboleth module installed.
